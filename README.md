## What does it do?

The app was designed to let you learn and memorize all Hiragana and Katakana characters

Each syllabary has section "Learn" and "Practice"

## Learn

The learn option displays tables with characters

## Practice

The practice option lets you check your knowledge

The app gets characters that you've checked and then puts them in a random order. Next each character is displayed either in Romaji (Transcription option) or as Japanese character (Characters option)

You can check if you remembered the character correctly by displaying the answer
